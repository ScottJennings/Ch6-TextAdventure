/**
 *  This class is the main class of the "World of Zuul" application. 
 *  "World of Zuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  Users 
 *  can walk around some scenery. That's all. It should really be extended 
 *  to make it more interesting!
 * 
 *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 *  method.
 * 
 *  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 *  rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
 *  executes the commands that the parser returns.
 * 
 * @author Scott Jennings
 * @version 2015.04.05
 * 
 * This version has 16 rooms and 6 new features
 * The new features are:
 * 1. up/down direction
 * 2. look command
 * 3. photo command (text confirmation)
 * 4. back command
 * 5. general item support (item object and printing in room description)
 * 6. support for multiple items in a room
 * 
 * Summary:
 * The world explored in this adventure is a natural science museum based on the D.C. Smithsonian.
 * It has 16 rooms on 3 floors and allows up/down movement between floors.  In addition to compass
 * direction moves, it supports a back move, a look command (replay room description), and a photo
 * command to take a photo of the room.  The rooms can contain contain zero or more items.  Making
 * the item an independent object will allow future versions to have a player carry items between rooms.
